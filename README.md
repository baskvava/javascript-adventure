OOP (Object Oriented Programming) vs FP (Functional Programming)

# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- Think as real world, Think as Object
- Everything think as function

# FP (Functional Programming)
- first-class citizen, can be considered as general parameters passing into function
- expression, not instruction (?)
- Pure, no side effect
  - what is the side effect? 
  - e.g. the expression "===", "!==" can help avoid side effect, but "==", "!=" cannot help avoid side effect, it may cause some unexpected results
- cannot change "input", cannot change "state"
